------------BROADLY------------------------------------
BiblioTycoon is a complete simulator for pure library &
bookstore systems as well as a hybrid between the two.
Some things possible in the game:
  -Build a Trilogy like bookstore to profitability
  -Build a functioning academic library with a predefined budget

But ultimately the game has to be the ultimate comfort and fun thing for the player to play through
with time becoming a non-factor when in it.
  which means :
    the game rewards more dedicated players with more complex tasks & finer control
    while at the same time also being fun for casual play
